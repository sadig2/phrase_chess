- Provide instruction on how to compile (if needed) and run
- Use only freely available tools, libraries and resources

Assignment

Create a server that
- accepts requests in JSON format and returns responses also in JSON format
- can handle parallel requests
- can be installed using a package manager
- has the code reasonably documented and tested

The task is to solve the problem of placing N chess figures on a chessboard of size NxN.
 The result is the number of possible solutions. A solution is a placement of N chess pieces on a NxN chessboard without any of them being attacked by another piece. It does not matter how you deal with symmetrical solutions, you can count each of them or consider them identical and therefore all of them contribute only once. The number of solutions only has to be consistent for every N.
 
Just to be clear:- result for placing queens and N=1 is 1- result for placing queens and N=2 is 0
 
 The requests will have the form {“n”:4, “chessPiece”: “queen”}, where the chessPiece can be one of “queen”, “bishop”, “knight” or “rook”. N is greater than 0 and less than 9. The server response should have the form {“solutionsCount”: 4}.
 
 
 The time and space complexity is not part of the exercise - the call has to return a number eventually, but can take a long time.
